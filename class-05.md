HTML Ch 5 - IMAGE

There are a lot of good reasons to add images to a web page. Whether it is a logo, photograph, diagram or you are trying to display something to a reader in an indirect way. 
We use < img > element to add an image to a page, src to tell where image comes from, alt to give any description, and title to give any additional information about the image. Height and width can be changed according to the needs and same thing with align which are typically left, right, top, middle, bottom. You also have to pay attention on the format of the image to use it properly. JPEG, GIF, PNG are some of the frequently used image formats. 

HTML Ch 11 – COLOR

A good web page has to have the good use of the colors whether it is a color of text or background color. In CSS, colors can be specified one of the three ways: RGB values [e.g. rgb(110, 110, 90)], HEX Codes [e.g. #ee3e80], Color names [e.g. Blue].
There are also contrasts (low contrast, high contrast, and medium contrast) which help you see if text is legible. You can also use color pickers to find the color you like. CSS3 came up with extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity which is called RGBA and HSLA for HSL values.

HTML Ch 12 – TEXT

Correct formatting of text is very important for the web pages to make them readable. Font, size, weight, style, spacing greatly affects how the page looks. We can make the text bold, italic, oblique or even stretch out the text. An important thing is that while choosing typeface, you need to know that the browser will only display if it is displayed on that user’s computer. Also, while using typeface, you need to pay attention to the copy right policy. You can also make the text uppercase/lowercase, use underline/strike, modify line-height, letter-spacing/word-spacing. 
Alignment is another nice feature on the text where there are left, right, center, justify alignments. And, pseudo-classes like :hover, :active, :focus will let users change the appearance making the pages more interactive.
