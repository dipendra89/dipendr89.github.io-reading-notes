<strong>HTML Chapter 4 (Links)</strong>

To create links, we use <a> element and href attribute which specifies the destination address. We have seen plenty of real life examples on links weather it is on online banking, school websites or any other web page. The target attribute is used to specify where to open linked document. For example, _blank opens the linked document in a new window or a tab whereas _self opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked.

<strong>HTML Chapter 15 (Layouts)</strong>

We use height, width, margin border, padding to control boxes to be used based on your layout needs. When talking about layouts, people use different devices with different screen sizes like phone, iPad/tablet, laptop, desktop etc.  
There are different Schemes. For example: Normal flow - in which each item appears on its own line, Relative Positioning – which positions the item on the basis of top, right, bottom, left, Absolute Positioning – which moves the element’s position, Fixed Positioning – which does not affect the position of surrounding elements, Floating elements – it will let you position the item to the far left or far right of the box.

<strong>JS Chapter 3 (Functions, Methods, and Objects) </strong>

Function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. We will be studying about function invocation, function return, local variables etcetera on this chapter. 

Simple Example:

function myFunction(p1, p2) {

  return p1 * p2;                                         // the function above returns the product of p1 and p2
  
}

Another Example:

var x = myFunction(4, 3);                                  // Function is called and return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {

  return a * b;                                             // Here, function returns the product of a and b
} 



<strong>Paired Programming</strong>

On paired programming, there are a driver and a navigator. The driver is the one who does all the typing and navigator directs the driver what to type/code. The navigator can be proactive and look for solution or research something but he/she typically won’t be writing code. 

<em>Major reasons for pair-programming are: </em>
1.	Greater efficiency – with catching the mistakes early, coming to solution faster
2.	Engaged collaboration – more engaged on the problem with less distraction
3.	Learning from fellow students – Different person has different point of view and you get to learn from completely separate prospective that you never thought of
4.	Social skills – People tend to think that programmers are not so social since they are just looking on the computer screen all the time. It will help to be social
5.	Job interview readiness – While doing pair programming in interview or just explaining the answer during interview, it will be helpful
6.	Work environment readiness – giving the real life experience and industry practice
