<strong>HTML Book Ch 15: CSS Layout (contâ€™d)</strong>

This chapter is all about how to control elements on a web page and create an attractive page layout. There are various ways to position elements like flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats. On a normal flow, every block-level element appears in a new line. This is a default behavior and paragraphs appear one after the other vertically down the page. Relative positioning moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it the top, right, bottom or left of where it would have been placed. Whereas, absolute positioning positions the element in relation to its containing element. Likewise, there are fixed and float positioning which are also used to make the layouts as needed. We also use z-index to control which elements sits on the top.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is its own box. The box will either be a block-level box or an in-line box. Clear property allows us to say that no element should touch the left or right-hand sides of box. 

Different visitors on the page will have different devices with different screen sizes, you want to have web page that works for all the devices with different screen sizes like smart phone, tablets, laptops, desktop etc. There is also the resolution comes to picture while dealing with various devices. What about the size of the page with or without having the user scrolling down? Fixed width layouts do not change the size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window whereas the liquid layout stretches or contracts as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. So, we will talk about all of these on this chapter.
