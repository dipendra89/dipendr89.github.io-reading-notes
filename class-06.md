JS Chapter 3 (Object Literals)
Object is a set of variables and functions. When a variable is a part of an object, we call it property of an object. For example, if an object is a Car: variables like make, model, year would be properties. When a function is a part of an object, we call it a method. 
 

JS Chapter 5 (Document Object Model)
The Document Object Model (DOM) tells how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript works in a web page while being on the browser. A simple example:
 
DOM has four types of nodes: documents nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. Element node can be selected by its id or class attributes. When DOM query returns more than one node, it will always return a NodeList. Using properties like textContent, innerHTML, you can access and update the content. An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements which are siblings of each other. The book also mentions that in older browsers, implementation of DOM is not consistent that is why we use JQuery.
