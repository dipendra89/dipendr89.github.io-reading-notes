HTML Book Ch 16: IMAGES

The chapter 16 explains about how we can use images on the web in various ways to make the page look better weather it is to adding background images or controlling the size of images. Like we say “picture speaks thousand words”, images are powerful for a webpage. 
Not only the size of the image, we can also use CSS to align images. Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS. Example:
                       img.image1 {
                           float: left;
                           width: 250px;
                            height: 250px;
                           }
Sometimes, just putting a right image as a background makes a whole lot of difference for the page. You can use background image just once or repeated across the background of the box.
By moving the background position of an image, you can create image rollover effects. Also, to reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
